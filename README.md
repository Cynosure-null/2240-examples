# 2240-examples

A collection of example code for FRC team 2240
Note that theese examples are not expected to compile right away, many of them need constants

# Adding a new example

Examples should be organized based on project, not file type.
For example, `NeoPid/NeoPid.cpp` and `NeoPid/NeoPid.h` is prefered over `cpp/NeoPid.cpp`and `include/NeoPid.h`
